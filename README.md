### Introduction to Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the model-template-view (MTV) architectural pattern and encourages the use of reusable code. With its vast ecosystem of packages, Django provides everything you need to build modern web applications quickly and easily.

### Building Blocks

The building blocks of a Django web application together to form a complete web application that can handle requests, manipulate data, and display the results to the user.

- [x] `Models`: define the structure of the data that will be stored in the database.
- [x] `Templates`: define the HTML structure that will be rendered in the browser.
- [x] `Views`: handle incoming requests and return the appropriate response. They connect the models and templates.
- [x] `URLs`: map URLs to views, allowing you to create patterns that determine how your application's pages are accessed.
- [x] `Middleware`: a set of hooks into Django's request/response processing. It allows you to add extra functionality, such as authentication or caching, to your application.

### Getting Started
To get started with Django, you will need to have a basic understanding of Python programming. If you are new to Python, we recommend that you take an introductory course or read a beginner's guide before diving into Django.

To install Django 4.0, run the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install django
```
